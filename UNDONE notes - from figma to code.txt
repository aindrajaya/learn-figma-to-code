#USING FIGMA
-figma has it own css property for each design
-the units property on figma is using px/pixel
-you don't need to follow the units based on figma
-you should convert the units to rem or em/ any relative length unit in css (%, vh, vw or any) rather than absolute length (px pt mm, or etc)

#UNITS EMs REMs
-em = Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font). These units grows based on the font-size grows on the selector itself, selector priority first rather than root.
-rem = Relative fo font-size of the root element. It will ignore the units from selector and will use the root or html.
-16px is the default font-size of the root element in the browser.
-So the main thing that we learn is about to convert margin padding unit by using the font-size units, so if in the figma the margin declared 32px and you should see the font-size first, and the you can decide to divide the margin with the font-size units (32 / 16(default font-size) = 2em). So the units that we should declare on the margin is 2em. [margin: 2em]

#Simple Card
first of all you need to build the markup div container, if you want to make your card clickable/create some events you can add the a/anchor tag inside the div container to wrap the image, title, description and the button link element.
